## Exploratory Data Analysis

Before building the prediction models, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand the data, its distribution, and the relationships between different features. This includes:

- Checking for missing values
- Visualizing the distribution of features
- Identifying correlations between features
- Investigating the target variable distribution

## Random Forest with Fine Tuning

A Random Forest model was built and fine-tuned to improve its predictive performance. The process includes:

- Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search 
- Evaluating different sets of hyperparameters
- Selecting the best model based on performance metrics

## SVM with Fine Tuning

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was built and fine-tuned. The steps include:

- Hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal parameters (C, gamma, kernel, etc.)
- Cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness
- Selecting the best performing model

## Predictions

Once the models were fine-tuned, predictions were made on the test dataset. This section includes:

- Generating predictions using the trained models
- Evaluating the predictions using appropriate metrics
- Comparing the performance of the models

## Results and Discussion

The results of the models were analyzed to determine their performance and effectiveness in predicting heart attacks. This section includes:

- Comparison of model performance
- Discussion of the most important features
- Insights and conclusions drawn from the analysis
